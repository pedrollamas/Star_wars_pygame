![Hello there](Img/hello_there.gif)

Dive into the Star Wars galaxy and get ready for an epic showdown between two legendary characters: Han Solo and a relentless Stormtrooper. Take control of your character, dodge enemy shots, and showcase your skills with the laser pistol.
## Description
This is an arcade-style game 🕹️ created with ![Pygame](https://img.shields.io/badge/Pygame-%23FFCA1C?style=for-the-badge&logo=pygame&logoColor=white). You can play 1️⃣ 🆚 1️⃣ with a friend using the same keyboard. Each player has 10 lives ♥️ and will take on the role of either Han Solo or a Stormtrooper.

My objective with this game was to learn the basics of Pygame, in order to create different mini-games in the future for fun. 
I hope you enjoy it, and I invite you to collaborate to improve it or create new games if you wish.
